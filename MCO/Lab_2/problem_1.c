/*(i) Write a C program to search for a given element in a matrix. The program should take a matrix and a target
element as input, and it should output whether the element is present in the matrix or not.

(ii) Modify your code so that you convert the code into a function called search().Signature of search() can be as below:
int search(int mat[][], int rows, int cols, int key).Let the search function return 0 on finding the key,
and return -1 if the key is not present in the matrix. Write a suitable main function which invokes
search() and observe your results. */
